# main module.  We do this with a combination of $0 and (maybe) $PWD.

# ${0:0:1} returns the first character of the $0 string
if [ ${0:0:1} == "/" ]

  # OK, called from an absolute path, just strip off the /bin
  STATS_HOME=`dirname $0`
else
  # Relative path - prepend $PWD
  STATS_HOME="${PWD}/`dirname $0`"

# Chop off the '/bin' at the end of STATS_HOME.
# (Note that if STATS_HOME doesn't end with '/bin', this command won't
# change anything.  In that case, we should probably spit out a warning.)
